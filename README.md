# IBC Eureka Modules for Voyager

Voyager is a modular IBC relayer maintained by [union](https://github.com/unionlabs/union), using a core binary to call other binaries known as "modules" to perform specific tasks. We can extend support for any IBC chain or implementation by adding new modules.

This repository contains work-in-progress IBC Eureka modules for Voyager, which are used to interact with [solidity-ibc-eureka](https://github.com/cosmos/solidity-ibc-eureka).

To install external dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
